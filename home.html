    <h1>Into the Washing Machine</h1>
    <h2>Are washing machines designed well for college students?</h2>
    <p>
    To answer this question, I studied the physical interface of a washing machine and observed three different college students using it. To understand more context around my observations, I surveyed each student about their experience and laundry habits. Finally, I created personas to summarize my findings and visualized one with a storyboard.
    </p>


    <h2> The Interface </h2>
    <p>
    The washing machine helps users keep their belongings looking and smelling clean by washing them in a quick, low-effort way, needing no supervision once a load has been started. This particular washing machine allows users to choose from simple categorical settings depending on the make-up of their load, in addition to letting them fine-tune specific controls such as the spin speed.

          <br>
          <b>**Controls B:</b> Slider-like options for the temperature, spin seed, and soil level
          <br>
          <b>***Controls C:</b> On/off options for clean washer, drain & spin, steam clean, extra rinse, pre soak, and load & go

    <h2> Observations </h2>
    <p>I observed the three users (one at a time) using the same washing machine, starting from when they started preparing their loads. The partcipants knew I was observing them, but were told to behave as if I wasn't. </p>
    <h3> User A </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Separated clothes from hamper into three piles: lights, darks, and undergarments </li>
        <li>Put the largest pile (darks) into the machine in one big lift </li>
        <li> After looking at how much space the clothes took up, added the light pile in as well </li>
        <li>Added two tide pods into load </li>
        <li>Left machine settings as default (regular/normal)</li>
        <li>Held down start button for 3 seconds (as directed on machine) </li>
        <li>Waited expectantly for 30 seconds as machine did not react </li>
        <li>Once machine made clicking sound and red lock popped up on screen, walked away satisfied </li>
        <li>Left to do homework</li>
        <li>Once the load finished, didn't notice for ~45 minutes, then moved the entire load to the dryer </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> User B </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Brought full hamper to washing machine </li>
        <li>Put each article of clothing into machine one-by-one </li>
        <li>Put towels, sheets, and one pair of shorts to the side </li>
        <li>Put in one tide pod </li>
        <li>Turned machine on by pressing button </li>
        <li>Looked at controls for a while, thinking </li>
        <li>Changed settings from default to delicates </li>
        <li>Pressed start button for 3 second (as directed on button) </li>
        <li>Stared at it, waited until machine started to spin (after the click sound and lock popped up on spring), and then walked away satisfied </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> User C </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Separated hamper into whites and colors (it was all clothing) </li>
        <li>Brought colors pile to machine and put it inside </li>
        <li>Stared at controls for 20 seconds, then pressed the ON button </li>
        <li>Felt around edge of detergent tray door and pulled out the tray and filled it with liquid detergent </li>
        <li>Pressed a few different controls before landing on “cold wash” </li>
        <li>Pressed start button-- nothing happened. Pressed the button again-- nothing happened </li>
        <li>Squinted at button and then held it down for three seconds and released </li>
        <li>When nothing immediately happened, pressed and held the button again </li>
        <li>Finally, a third time, held the button and waited, and once the machine clicked did not press button again </li>
        <li>Waited more until the machine started to spin, then walked away </li>
        <li>Set timer on phone for the amount of time remaining (as indicated on the machine) </li>
        <li>When timer went off, returned to machine and there were 5 minutes remaining </li>
        <li>Waited for the load to finish, then removed clothes from machine and hung them on personal drying rack in room </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Interview Questions </h2>
    <p>Directly after each user finished their washing machine experience, I interviewed them about their experience using the same set of 11 questions. The questions and summaries of the users' answers are shown below. </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="question">How often do you use a washing machine? </li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A washes her clothes weekly, User B monthly, and User C every two weeks. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">When was the last time you did your laundry? </li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A did her laundry about three weeks ago, User B about six weeks ago, and User C about two weeks ago. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">On a scale of 1-10, how much do you like doing laundry (1 being you absolutely hate it, 10 being you look forward to it)?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Users A and C said they didn’t love doing laundry, but liked having clean clothes so rated their like-level at a 5. User B said she dreaded doing laundry and put it off as much as possible so rated herself as a 2. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">Imagine your hamper is full of dirty laundry––including athletic wear, casual wear, dressy attire, undergarments, and towels, all of which have a diversity of colors. How would you separate out your loads?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A said she would separate the hamper into three loads: lights, darks, and towels. User C said the same except the “lights” pile would be strictly white and gray clothing, and anything colored would go in the “dark” pile. User B said she would separate into two piles: clothes and towels. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">For each load you said you would do, what settings on the washing machine would you use?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A said she would use the default/normal setting for all three loads, but would turn the temperature one notch higher than the default for the towels load. User B said she would use the “delicate” setting for the clothing loads and the “towels” setting for the towel load. User C said he would use the “cold wash” setting for the clothing loads, and the default settings for the towels. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">Why would you pick these settings?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A said she wasn’t sure what the pre-set settings (i.e. towels) would do, so she felt that normal was the safest and hasn’t had any issues with it. She makes the temperature higher for the towels because she’s not worried about them shrinking and thinks the higher temperature cleans them better. </li>
            <li>User B said that she wasn’t totally sure what the delicate setting meant, but that she figured it was better that the machine treats her clothes delicately to prevent them from getting damaged. She uses the towel setting because it “seems fitting” for towels. </li>
            <li>User C said he uses the cold wash because he is afraid that the washing machine will shrink his clothes. Like User A, he is not worried about towels so washes them with the normal setting. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">What type of detergent do you use? (i.e. liquid detergent, powder, tide pods)</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Users A and B use tide pods; User C uses liquid detergent. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">How do you dry your clothes once they are finished?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Users A and B put them directly into the dryer. User C chooses not to use the dryer and hang-dries them because he is worried about the dryer shrinking his clothes. For the towels load, he uses the dryer. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">What (if anything) do you like about this washing machine?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>All three users mentioned liking the convenience of having a washing machine directly in their apartment. User B also mentioned liking having presets for different types of loads (i.e. towels) so she doesn’t need to worry about the best settings to use for different loads. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">What (if anything) frustrated or annoyed you about this washing machine?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>User A didn’t like the preset options (i.e. towels) because she didn’t know what settings they entailed and what they would do to her clothes. User C thought the start button was very frustrating because it didn’t provide immediate feedback. He also thought which side to open the door on was very unclear, since the two sides look the same. User B wasn’t frustrated by anything. </li>
            </ul>
        <li class="question">If you could add a feature to this washing machine, what would it be?</li>
            <ul>
            <li>User B suggested a more welcoming interface including encouraging messages to “make doing laundry more fun. “ User C would like a notification when his load is done since he sometimes forgets to set a timer on his phone and then completely forgets about the load. User A did not have any suggestions. </li>
            </ul>


    </ul>

    <h2> Personas </h2>
    <p>After I collected this data, I created two personas based off of my observations and interviews. </p>

    <div class="persona-box">
        <h3> Careful Cary </h3>
        <p> Cary is a junior at Brown University who believes in a more minimalist lifestyle. He has a small collection of clothing which he rotates through, so any article of clothing getting ruined would go very noticed. He generally likes things to be clean and doesn’t mind spending extra time on something in order to do it right. </p>

          <img src="persona_cary.png"/>
          <figcaption><b>Empathy map for Careful Cary</b></figcaption>
        </figure>

    </div>
    <div class="persona-box">
        <h3>Stressed Susan</h3>
        <p>Susan is a senior at Brown University who has a lot on her plate: exams, papers, and job interviews. She lives in an off-campus apartment with three roommates. She usually prefers to do her work in the library because it is where she is most productive. She has a large collection of T-shirts and jeans which she mixes and matches for her outfits. </p>

          <figcaption><b>Empathy map for Stressed Susan</b>  </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <h2> Storyboard </h2>
    <p>For the final step of the process, I flushed out one of the personas, Stressed Susan, even more by creating a storyboard for how she might do a load of laundry.</p>
    <figure class="storyboard-img">

 <h2> Conclusion & Takeaways </h2>
 <p>After completing this project, I believe that this particular washing machine is very versatile to different college students' needs. While there are some basic design changes that would improve everyones experiences––such as a more clearly labeled door, more accurate time estimates for how long the load will take, and more immediate feedback after you press start––overall, the different options in the controls allow for everyone to find something that they like. A good next step would be to survey more users, better spanning different years at college (i.e. freshman, sophomore, grad students). Due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, this was not possible. </p>
